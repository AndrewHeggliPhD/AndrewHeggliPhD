# Who is Dr. Andrew Heggli? 👨‍💼📈

Hi, I'm Andrew! 👋 I am a data analyst with a Phd in Applied statistics from the Norwegian University of Life Sciences. I love coding and statistics and have expertise in: 

- Programming in R (currently learning SQL)
- Statistical modelling
- Excel
- Scientific writing
- Data visualization
- Communicating complex data to groups with varied backgrounds

As my background is within research and life sciences, the software I have used is popular within academia. I am currently transitioning to working as a data analyst, and I am therefore learning SQL and will move on to PowerBI as soon as possible.
