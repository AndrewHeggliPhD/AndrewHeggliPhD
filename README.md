# Who is Dr. Andrew Heggli? 👨‍🔬📈

Hi, I'm Andrew! 👋 I am a data analyst with a Phd in Applied statistics from the Norwegian University of Life Sciences. I love coding and statistics and have expertise in: 

- Statistical modelling
- Programming in R
- Excel
- Scientific writing
- Communicating complex data to groups with varied backgrounds

As my background is within research and life sciences, the software I have used is popular within academia. I am currently transitioning to working as a data analyst, and I am therefore learning SQL and will move on to PowerBI as soon as possible.
