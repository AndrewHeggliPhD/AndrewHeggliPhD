# Who is Dr. Andrew Heggli? 👨‍💼📈

Hi, I'm Andrew! 👋 

I am a **PhD Applied Statistician** and **Quantitative Researcher** based in Oslo. My background is in biological systems, but my core expertise is statistical logic : distinguishing between prediction and understanding, and building models that accurately reflect the structure of the data. I highly value methodological integrity, as verifying that the assumptions behind a model are met is integral to ensuring results are sound.

I specialize in separating systematic signal from random noise using **Linear Mixed Models (LMM)** and **Multivariate Regression**, and have extensive experience working with complex, hierarchical datasets.

**My Technical Toolkit:**
*   **Language:** R (Advanced proficiency: `lme4`, `tidyverse`, base R).
*   **Modeling:** Mixed Models, Multivariate Analysis, Residual Analysis & Validation.
*   **Data Strategy:** Building reproducible pipelines for data cleaning, merging, and integrity verification.

### 🏆 Key Projects

[AutomaticLibrary (R ETL Script)](https://github.com/AndrewHeggliPhD/AutomaticLibrary)
**Bespoke Automated Data Management Tool**
*   **The Problem:** Need to aggregate daily server extracts into a persistent, updateable library.
*   **The Solution:** Developed a **custom data management script** in R. The system handles incremental data extraction, state management, and updates via a robust flat-file architecture (.csv/.txt), ensuring data integrity. (Post PhD)

[PhD Paper II (Rscript)](https://github.com/AndrewHeggliPhD/Paper-II)
**Multivariate Regression & Covariance Structures**
*   **Methodology:** Applied multivariate regression to model seven correlated yield outcomes simultaneously.
*   **Key Feature:** Quantified residual covariance structures to capture complex dependencies between variables that standard univariate models would have missed.

[PhD Paper I (Rscript)](https://github.com/AndrewHeggliPhD/Paper-I)
**Statistical Validation of Prediction Models**
*   **Methodology:** Comparative analysis of a objective prediction model vs. human expert classification.
*   **Key Feature:** Analysis of prediction bias ($\mu$) and variance components to validate industrial implementation.
